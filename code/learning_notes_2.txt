For task two, our mentor taught us what is exploratory data analysis which, in short, is EDA.
EDA is one basic step in data mining, either for project or contest.
EDA's definition(from wikipedia):
In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
through visualization, we are able to find some realtions between data, which is helpful for subsequent feature construction
To build a good model, we had better continuously do EDA and data processing and mining in order to achieve better data structure and distribution and stronger related features.

For this project, our data set is second-hand car transcation price data set.
During the second tutorial, I learned how to use apis provided by pandas ,seaborn, missingno, matplotlib to load data, have
a basic view of data, get the attributes of data, preprocess data for missing data and abnormal data, visualize data.

Details(added later):
Introductions on python packages I mentioned above
called APIs(including its return value and some important parameters)
