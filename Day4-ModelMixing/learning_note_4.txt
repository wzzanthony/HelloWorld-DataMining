For task 5, we are going to mix different models together ,which is the last but important step of the match.

In general, stacking & blending contains three main types:

1.simple weighted fusion:
  (1) Regression: Arithmetic mean, Geometric mean
  (2) Classification: Voting
  (3) Comprehensive: Rank averaging, log fusion

2.stacking/blending
  build one multiply layer model and predict based on former prediction result

3.boosting/bagging
  improve the accuracy based on multiple trees

To improve the robust of the model:
1.fusion over result aspect:
This is the most common fusion method, and there are many feasible fusion methods, 
such as weighted fusion according to the score of the results, Log and Exp processing, etc. 
When doing result fusion, there is a very important condition that the scores of model results should be relatively similar, 
and then the differences of results should be relatively large. Such result fusion often has better effect improvement.

2.fusion over feature aspect:
In fact, this level does not feel like fusion, but rather segmentation. Most of the time, 
if we use the same model for training, we can segment the features into different models, 
and then carry out model or result fusion later, which can sometimes produce better results.

3.fusion over model aspect:
Fusion at the model level may involve stacking and design of models, 
such as adding Staking layer and taking the results of some models as feature inputs. 
These require more experiments and thinking. 
Fusion at the model level is best based on certain differences between different model types, 
and the benefits of using different parameters of the same model are generally relatively small.
