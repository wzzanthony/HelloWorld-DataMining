For task 4, we are about to learn how to build basic machine learning model and tune parameters
The mentor share many useful materials for us to take reference.
Below are the basic description of the materials and links to them:

Linear Regression Model: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/49480391
Decision Tress Model: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/65304798
GBDT Model: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/45145899
XGBoost Model: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/86816771
LightGBM Model: https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/89360721

First, we need to load data. During this process, we are able to reduce the memory use
through change the type of the given data.

Then our mentor showed us how to build the basic linear regression model. Our mentor pointed out
that it doesn't satisfy the assumption of regression analysis

we should do one modification to the price column
Our mentor did 5-fold crossValidation to simulate the real case in our life

Afterwards, our mentor guided us to build more models and compare each of them through data visualization.

Finally, it is to tune parameters. Our mentor introduced three methods and the links to the three methods has been shared above
